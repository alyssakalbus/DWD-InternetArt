            <h3>Deadly by Design:</h3>
            <h4>This section is derived from a transcription of Meredith Whittaker's SXSW interview from March 7, 2025: "A Conversation About Online Security and Confidentiality"</h4>
            <p> Imagine that every single message you’ve ever sent in your life is suddenly in one database, and a link just got sent to everyone you know. 
                That’s your boss, your best friend, your dad’s best friend, the weird guy who comes to your Thanksgiving. They click on that link and they 
                can access that database, and there’s this little AI bot that’s appended onto that database. So they can quickly summarize everything in that 
                database. They can search their name, search that time you told that weird lie because you hadn’t had coffee, search that time you talked shit 
                about your best friend because you were in a weird place and you feel really bad about it. Or what about that message to your doctor? Your 
                prescription information? What about that time you sent to your colleague something that was meant for the other colleagues? The time you 
                talked to a union organizer? The times you reported corruption at your workplace to a journalist? All of that is in there. How much of
                your life would survive that?</p>
            <p>There is a woman now living in prison because Meta handed over her Facebook DMs to law enforcement in Nebraska post-Dobbs. 
                Those were key sources of evidence used to convict her, of accessing and dealing with the reprocussions of reproductive health.
                So wherever you sit, that's a very clear example of a difference maker. This is private communications made public by a company that
                collected them.</p>
            <p> AI is useful for finding patterns in large amounts of data, assuming your data is good. And AI does a lot of interesting things, but it is built
                on the surveillence business model that we have right now. This sort of deep learning moment we're still in that started more or less
                around 2012. At least that's when the investments started coming in. There was this paper that introduced the AlexNet algorithm. The AlexNet paper
                showed that an old algorithm developed in the late 1980s . . . it revealed that if you had a huge amount of data and you had really powerful compute . . .
                that you could actually do something interesting in terms of objective seeking. And of course, that's when the surveillance industry really perked up their
                ears.</p>
            <p> And now we're seeing this come through in a really obvious way. There's sort of this search for data. There's the scraping of libgen, you know, the more
                data the better. And how do we produce more? How do we create more? How do we sort of whittle away privacy safeguards so that we can get more data?

            <h3>A Problem of Design:</h3>
            <h4>This section is derived from Hito Steryl's "How to Kill People: A Problem of Design" originally published in "Duty Free Art: Art in the Age of Planetary Civil War" in 2017.</h4>
            <p>In his 1963 film How to Kill People designer George Nelson argues that killing is a matter of design next to fashion 
                and homemaking. Nelson states that design is crucial in improving both the form and function of weapons. It deploys 
                aesthetics to improve lethal technology.</p>
            <p>Disruptive innovation is causing social polarization through the decimation of jobs, mass surveillance and algorithmic 
                confusion. It facilitates the fragmentation of societies by creating anti-social tech monopolies that spread bubbled 
                resentment, change cities, magnify shade and maximize poorly paid freelance work. The effects of these social and 
                technological disruptions include nationalist, sometimes nativist, fascist or ultrareligious mass movements. Creative 
                disruption, fueled by automation and cybernetic control, runs in parallel with an age of political fragmentation. The 
                forces of extreme capital, turbocharged with tribal and fundamentalist hatred, reorganize within more narrow entities.</p>
            <p>In modernist science fiction, the worst kinds of governments used to be imagined as a single artificial intelligence 
                remote controlling society. However todays real existing proto-and parafascisms rely on decentralized artificial 
                stupidity. Bot armies, like farms and filter bubbles, form the gut brains of political sentiment, manufacturing 
                shitstorms that pose as popular passion. The idea of technocrat fascist rule — supposedly detached, omniscient and 
                sophisticated — is realized as a barrage of dumbed down tweets. Democracy’s demos is replaced by a mob on mobiles 
                capturing peoples activities, motion and vital energies. But in contrast to the modernist dystopias, current 
                autocracies do not rely on the perfection of such systems. They rather thrive on their permanent breakdown, 
                dysfunction and so-called “predictive” capacities to create havoc.</p>
            <p>While dreaming of the one technological singularity to once-and-for-all render humanity superfluous, disruption 
                as a social, aesthetic and militarized process creates countless little singularities, entities trapped within 
                the horizons of what autocrats declare as their own history, identity, culture, ideology, race or religion; each 
                with their own incompatible rules, or more precisely, their own incompatible lack of rules. “Creative disruption” 
                is not just realized by the wrecking of buildings and urban areas. It refers to the wrecking of a horizon of common 
                understanding, replacing it by narrow, parallel, top-down, trimmed and bleached artificial histories.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Weapons & Actual Weapons:</h3>
            <h4>This section is derived from "When Futurism Led to Facsim — and Why It Could Happen Again" published on April 18, 2019 by Rose Eveleth in Wired. </h4>
            <p>Today, when we talk about futurism, we’re not usually talking about sculpture, painting, 
                or poetry. Futurists today are scenario builders, people with advanced degrees in strategic 
                foresight, science fiction writers, consultants to businesses. Futurists focus largely on 
                technology, and the field today is inextricably linked to technologists working on everything 
                from artificial intelligence to Crispr. And today’s Futurists almost never link their work to 
                the existence of Marinetti, and the Italian movement that came before them. This is in part because 
                Marinetti was an artist, and the Italian Futurists worked in paint and bronze and clay, rather than 
                future forecasts. And there is no direct link between Marinetti's group and the strategic foresight 
                consultants working today. But the link is also one that today's futurists would prefer to avoid in 
                part because of another element of the artists behind the Futurist Manifesto of 1909: Marinetti and his 
                cohort embraced and championed fascism. There are lessons to be learned for today’s technologists and 
                futurists in Marinetti’s manifesto, and it would be foolish to ignore them.</p>
            <p>Let’s first take a look at the words often used to describe the Italian Futurist movement: invention, 
                modernity, speed, industry, disruption, brash, energetic, combative. Italian Futurists were obsessed with 
                cars and airplanes; they emphasized youth over experience; they believed that the only way to live was by 
                pushing forward and never looking back. The first tenet in the manifesto reads, “We intend to sing the love 
                of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness.”</p>
            <p>Does any of this sound familiar? Disruption? Moving fast (and perhaps breaking things)? The rejection of history? 
                Today’s most vocal voices in tech might not communicate their values with the same aplomb as the Italian poets, 
                but they’re often saying the same kinds of things. Here’s a quote from Anthony Levandowski, cofounder of Waymo, 
                about the value of history: “The only thing that matters is the future. I don’t even know why we study history. 
                It’s entertaining, I guess—the dinosaurs and the Neanderthals and the Industrial Revolution, and stuff like that. 
                But what already happened doesn’t really matter. You don’t need to know that history to build on what they made. 
                In technology, all that matters is tomorrow.” Here’s a quote from the 1909 manifesto: “Why should we look back, 
                when what we want is to break down the mysterious doors of the Impossible?” Where Marinetti declares “We stand 
                on the last promontory of the centuries!” today’s technology moguls say “the future is now.” Where the Italian 
                Futurists were hypnotized by cars and planes, today’s technologists are drooling over rocket ships and space 
                travel. Where Marinetti believed that women were too effeminate to bring about the kind of speedy progress he 
                desired, former Google employee James Damore writes about how the gender gap in tech exists because men and women 
                "biologically differ".</p>
            <p>Today’s technologists love to eschew history for the same reason the Italian Futurists did, but if they ignore the
                lessons contained in that movement, they’re bound to repeat it. And I’ll leave it to you to guess who said this,
                Marinetti or Musk: “Standing on the world's summit we launch once again our insolent challenge to the Stars!”</p>

            <h3>Embedded Propaganda:</h3>
            <h4>This section is derived from "Slopoganda: The Interaction Between Propoganda and Generative AI" published March 2, 2025. </h4>
            <p>Methods of propaganda have always been tied to technology. After the Renaissance, the printing press became a tool of mass influence. 
                Pamphlets, gazettes, and posters were the first by design means to change the informational ecosystem for large groups sufficiently to 
                facilitate a desired end. After the advent of electrification, new technologies entered the stage. Joseph Goebbels, for example, commissioned 
                the Volksempfänger, or “people’s receiver” to broadcast nazi propaganda directly into people’s homes. Propaganda is now almost universally 
                associated with totalitarian states, perhaps thanks to George Orwell’s 1984 and people like Goebbels. However, propaganda has not always been at 
                the service of totalitarian states (Stanley 2015). The first official institution dedicated to it was in the Vatican, at the service of the Catholic 
                church’s evangelizing mission. Propaganda methods were used throughout the church’s domains, but especially among Indigenous people of conquered lands 
                administered by European colonizing empires. Napoleonic France repurposed these methods to build a particular image of Napoleon, the Grand Armee, and France. 
                Then, eventually, so did every other major state, including the Soviet Union and the United States. Propaganda is, by definition, propagated: it needs to be 
                spread widely to even count as an instance of the category. Following other scholars, we hold that not all propaganda is false. Even Goebbels famously held that,
                for the Big Lie to be effective, it had to be intermixed with some truth.  
                </p>
            <p>Both slopoganda and propoganda aim to influence viewpoints or ideologies, altering the informational
                environment en massee to reach a desired aggregate change is decision-making at the group level. However,
                advancements in communication technologies and GAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) differentiate them,
                particularly in terms of the emergence and dissemination of messages in the propoganda narrative. Traditional
                propoganda relied on media such as yellow press, pamphlets, radio broadcasts, and television. With the rise
                of the World Wide Web and social media platforms, this evolved into computational propoganda by the use of
                social bots and algorithmic mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>It's All Trash:</h3>
            <h4>This section is derived from a transcription of "Generative AI Is Not A Real Industry" via Better Offline published Feb 28, 2025.</h4>
            <p>The venture capitalists are so fucking wrong, and so are the hyperscalers. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Let's look at some estimated numbers that I got from data intelligence 
                firm Sensor Tower, and that's referring to these monthly active users on apps and web, which is just unique monthly active visitors to websites. And this is for 
                the biggest players in AI in January 2025. And I must be clear, the following really fucked me up a little:</p>
            <p>So OpenAI’s ChatGPT had 339 million monthly active users on ChatGPT’s app and 246 million monthly visitors to ChatGPT.com in January 2025. Pretty good, right? One would
                assume that everybody else, especially the hyperscalers, they'd be pretty close behind, right? They've got way more money, they've got a ton of advertising, and one would be
                wrong. Google Gemini had a pathetic 18 million monthly active users on the Gemini app and a mere 47.3 million unique monthly users on their website. For comparison, CNN.com has
                over 150 million unique monthly visitors, and did not require purchasing billions of dollars of GPUs. Nevertheless, though, Microsoft, who funds OpenAI, they wouldn’t have blown
                this right?</p>
            <p>Wrong, so very wrong. Microsoft Copilot had an embarrassing 11 million monthly active users on the Copilot app, and 15.6 million unique monthly visitors. I mean, they had a fucking
                Super Bowl commercial a year ago. Man, what the hell? These are terrible numbers for a company with a market capitalization of $3 trillion that spent over $75 billion dollars on capital
                expenditures in 2024.</p>
            <p>But you know what, maybe it’s just that big tech hasn’t worked it out. The plucky start of Silicon Valley must have, right? I mean, we’ve all heard about Perplexity. They seem to be
                giving away pro accounts all the time. They’re pretty big, right, they must be . . . wrong. They had an abominable 8 million monthly active users on their app in January, and 10.6
                million unique monthly active visitors to Perplexity.ai. This company has raised $665 million. They have a multi-billion dollar evaluation. This is absolutely fucking pathetic. </p>
            <p>What are we doing here? But you know, maybe I’m just being a sour pus. Maybe I’m just being a hater.</p>
            <p>Obviously, there’s one hulking juggernaut I’ve been leaving out and I would never ever ever leave them out. Because Anthropic has raised $14.7 billion, one would assume with all
                of this money, with all of this press attention . . . They must be huge. They must be  huge, right right? Right, then so flipping wrong. Anthropic’s Claude, and I shit you not, had
                2 million monthly active users on the Claude app and 8.2 million unique monthly visitors on Claude.ai and that’s the web based version of their app. </p>
            <p>These numbers are absolutely abominable. They’re trash, they’re garbage. Anyone’s that’s saying that Anthropic has a real product is talking out of their asshole.</p>
            <p>But what’s really funny is that the recently emerged DeepSeek had 27 million monthly active users on the DeepSeek app and 79.9 million unique monthly visitors to DeepSeek.com in January.
                This, by the way, doesn’t capture DeepSeek’s China based users . . . the app has nearly 10 million downloads on the Vivo store, which is just one of the different Android app marketplaces
                serving mainland China. But for the sake of simplicity, assume that all of these numbers refer to those outside of China, where most, if not all, of the Western made chatbots are blocked
                by the Great Firewall. But let me put this into perspective:</p>
            <p>The entire combined monthly active users of Microsoft Copilot, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Perplexity apps amount to 66 million monthly active users . . . Web traffic slightly
                improves things, I say sarcastically, with 161 million unique monthly visitors that visited the websites for Copilot, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Perplexity . . . So without ChatGPT,
                It appears that the entire generative ai app market is a little more than half the size of Pokemon Go at it’s peak, which had around 147 million monthly active users . . . These numbers
                are simply pissed poor. They’re a sign that the market for generative ai is incredibly small, and based on the fact that every single one of these apps loses money, they’re actively
                harmful for their respective investors or owners. I do not think this is a real industry, and I believe that if we pulled the plug on the venture capital aspect on it tomorrow,
                it would die. It would die in a month, maybe two. </p>
            <p>This software is being forced on people at scale by corporations desperate to seem futuristic without any real understanding as to why they need to do so, and whatever use cases may
                exist for large language models are dwarfed by how utterly unprofitable this whole fucking fiasco is. . . Tim Cook of Apple has forced Apple Intelligence barely functional software on
                millions and millions of people because Apple has no more ideas. Mark Zuckerberg of Meta has pushed AI on everything because he has no more ideas left, and it's going to burn so much money
                in Meta and Sam Altman and Dario Amodei are two fucking liars, two liars who will tell you that their software will turn into artificial general intelligence. They're lying. They're all lying.</p>
