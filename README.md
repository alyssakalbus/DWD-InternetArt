# Dynamic Web Development Week 1

Code a simple website using ONLY HTML and CSS inspired by Rhizome's Artbase.

Availble to View On Glitch [Here](https://ruby-brindle-sleet.glitch.me/) - unfortunately the custom cursor doesn't work :(

## Mood Board and Inspiration

I wanted to play arounud with some 3D scanned objects / 3D models as navigation but only using HTML and CSS. 

I figured I could take my 3D assets into After Effects, make them more dynamic, and export as gifs. I then matched the motion using basic CSS animation and created 6 floating navigation anchors that take you though the gigantic sea of text.

## Final Website

Obviously the UI/UX of this is dogshit, but it was fun to make.
